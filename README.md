# **Shopify Performance Dashboard**  

## üìå Purpose of the Project

This project delivers a **dynamic Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze Shopify sales and customer report data through a **self-service analytics** approach‚Äîno SQL required.

The workflow is centered around familiar and accessible tools:

* **Excel** is used for initial data exploration and analysis.
* **Power Query** handles the transformation and cleaning of raw Shopify CSV exports (orders, customers, products).
* **Power BI** brings the data to life with interactive visualizations, letting users explore key KPIs like Net Sales, AOV, Repeat Rates, and LTV.

The goal is to **democratize data access**‚Äîgiving business users, marketers, and analysts the power to uncover insights, filter by region or product type, and make data-driven decisions in real time.
